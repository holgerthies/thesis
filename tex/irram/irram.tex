\section{iRRAM}
	\irram is a \cc framework for exact real arithmetic developed by Norbert M\"uller.

	Since the case studies in this thesis were all implemented  in \irram, the
  following section will give a short overview over the \irram framework.

	\irram extends \cc by a data-type \real for error free computations with real numbers.
  For the user, an object of type \real behaves like a real number that can be
  manipulated without any rounding errors.
  The framework takes care of all details necessary to internally  finitely represent real
  numbers, and in most cases the internal representation will be invisible for
  the user.
	\subsection{Real Number representation}
		\irram's approach is similar to the bottom-up DAG approach described in
    Section \ref{sec:exact real arithmetic}.

		There is one important difference tough: The DAGs are not really
    constructed.
		Instead, there is only enough information saved, so that the whole
    computation can be repeated.
    If the precision at some point of the program does not suffice, the whole
    program is restarted with higher precision. 
    This reduced the needed memory to a minimum.

    For making error analysis, \irram uses a simplified form of interval
    arithmetic.

		At every time during the program execution, the internal representation of
    a real number is always a \textbf{single} interval. 
    More precisely a real number $x \in \RR$ is represented by a pair $(d,e)$ such that $x \in [d-e, d+e]$.

 		$d$ is saved as a multiple precision number and $e$ consists of two \code{long}s $p,z$ such that $e = p \cdot 2^p$.

    The internal representation of a \real can change during the run of the
    program.
 		
 	  Whenever the precision of some \real is not sufficient at some point during
    the program flow, the whole computation is restarted, and the
    representations of the reals change, to admit higher precision.

 		This process of restarting the whole computation with higher precision is called
    \textbf{iteration} in the terminology of \irram.
    Since a reiteration is only done, when higher precision is needed, there
    are only few operations, such as comparisons or output, that can trigger such a reiteration.

    An \irram program will usually do several iterations of the computation,
    until the desired output precision is reached.
    
	\subsection{Overview}
	  The following gives an overview over the most important classes and
    functions provided by the \irram framework. For a more detailed overview
    see \cite{irram}.
		
    \irram provides some classes for discrete valued structures, in particular
    the class \code{INTEGER} for infinite sized integers, the class
    \code{RATIONAL} for rational numbers and the class \code{DYADIC} for dyadic
    rational numbers. 

    The most important class is \real, the class for error free computations
    with real numbers. 

		An object of type \real can be constructed from \code{int}, \code{char*}, \code{double}, \code{DYADIC} 
		or another \real. 

		Arithmetic operations can be applied on \real s by using the overloaded operators \code{+}, \code{-}, \code{*},
		\code{/}.

		Many functions on \real s are already included in the \irram package, e.g. 
		\code{abs(x)}, \code{power(x, n)}, \code{exp(x)}, \code{log(x)},
		trigonometric functions and their inverse and many more.

		The operators \code{<}, \code{<=}, \code{==}, \code{>=}, \code{>} are also
    overloaded.
    Note, however, that comparison operators have to be used carefully, as will be explained in the
    next section.
    
   \irram further provides classes for complex numbers and real matrices.

		An \irram program is written in usual \cc extended by the data-types provided by a framework.
		However, a few things have to be kept in mind when writing a program
		\begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{compute function}
        The \irram framework already writes the \cpp \code{main} function, so
        the main function can not be used.
        Instead it is replaced by a function \code{void iRRAM :: compute() }.
        The main part of the program should be written inside this function.
      \item \textbf{Input and Output}
        The input and output streams \code{cin} and \code{cout} are overloaded
        with \irram versions, that can read and write real numbers. 
        The precision of the output can be adjusted with the parameterized
        manipulator \code{setrwidth} that sets the number of digits that are
        written. 
        Alternatively the function \code{rwrite(REAL\& r, int prec)} can be used
        to write a real number with a given number of decimals.
      \item \textbf{Global variables} Since the \irram only reiterates what is
        inside the compute function, global variables will not be part of the
        reiteration. Therefore, \real variables should never be defined
        globally.
		\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Multivalued Functions}
		TTE can be used as a theoretical model to reason about \irram programs.
		Thus, the limitations seen in Chapter \ref{sec:real computability} also hold for \irram programs.  
		In particular, every function computable with \irram is necesserily continuous.
		
		That also implies, that comparisons and tests for equality of {\real}s are not computable when the input numbers are equal.

		Indeed, two numbers can only be compared if the intervals they are represented by do not overlap. 
		Thus, if the intervals overlap, \irram has to reiterate. But if the numbers are equal, the intervals will always overlap, 
		no matter how small they are, leading to an infinite loop of iterations.
		
		In practice, this is achieved by letting those functions have type \code{LAZY\_BOOLEAN}.
 		\code{LAZY\_BOOLEAN} realizes ternary logic
		$T, F,\bot$, where $\bot$ means that the current information is not sufficent to make a decision.
		When casting to \code{bool} $\bot$ leads to reiteration. The semantics of \code{LAZY\_BOOLEAN} can be found in Table.

		Not being able to make comparisons might first seem like a huge disadvantage, but note that in numerical practice it is also strongly advised to never test floating point numbers on equality.
		The \code{gnu gcc} compiler even has a warning option on that:
		\begin{quotation}
				\noindent
		\begin{verbatim}
			-Wfloat-equal
			  Warn if floating-point values are used in equality comparisons.

			  The idea behind this is that sometimes it is convenient (for the programmer) to consider 
			  floating-point values as approximations to infinitely precise real numbers. [...]
			  Instead of testing for equality, you should check to see whether the two values 
			  have ranges that overlap; and this is done with the relational operators, so equality 
			  comparisons are probably mistaken. 
		    \end{verbatim}
		\end{quotation} 

		In contrast to that \irram has however, a sementically correct way to handle comparisons and other
		cases of non-continuity: multi-valued functions.

		In \irram a multi-valued function can have multiple valid outputs for the same input and 
		return seemingly indeterministic one of the valid outputs (of course, everything is deterministic in the 
		interval representation of the input numbers, but that is usually not observed by the user).
		
		\irram already has some multi valued functions included, e.g. the function
		\begin{equation*}
			bound(x,k) = 
			\begin{cases}
				\code{true} & \mbox{if } | x | \leq 2^{k-2} \\
				\code{true} \mbox{ or } \code{false} & \mbox{if } 2^k \geq |x| > 2^{k-2} \\
				 \code{false}  & \mbox{if } |x| > 2^k.
			\end{cases}
		\end{equation*}
		can be used for multi-valued comparisons.

		Another example is the function \code{approx(const REAL\& x, const long p)} that returns a \code{DYADIC} 
		approximation with error less than $2^{-k}$ to $x$.	

		One way to construct multi-valued functions without accessing the internal representation of the {\real}s 
		is to use \code{LAZY\_BOOLEAN} together with the \code{choose}-function.
		\code{choose} is a multi-valued function that takes up to 6 lazy booleans and returns the index of one 
		that is evaluated to $T$ or $0$ if all evaluate to $F$ (leading to reiteration as long as neither of the two cases hold).

		The possibility to have multi-valued functions introduces a new problem: 
		A multi-valued function can have different results for different representations of the same real number,
		thus the outcome could also change in different iterations of the \irram. 
		Thus, the program flow could be completely change from one iteration to another, leading to unexpected results.
		To prevent that from happening, the result of a multi-valued function is saved in the so called \textbf{multi-value cache}
		and read from there when reiterating. 
		Thus, it is guaranteed that the program flow stays the same in each iteration.
		This makes, however, the use of multi-valued functions memory-intensive and they should therefore be used with care,
		especially inside loops.
	\subsection{Limits}
		\irram also has the feature to generate new user-defined {\real}s by using a special \code{limit} operator.
		There are three types of limits
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item \textbf{Simple limits}: \\
			This limit has the form
			\begin{verbatim}
				REAL limit(REAL a(long, const REAL&), const REAL& x).
			\end{verbatim}

			The limit operator takes a sequence of real functions that converges to a single-valued function $f: \RR \to \RR$
			rapidly, i.e. such that 
			$$|a_p(x) - f(x)| \leq 2^p \text{ for all } x \in dom(f)$$
			and returns the value of $f(x)$ as a \real.

			There exist similiar functions to compute limits of sequences of functions with $0$ or $2$ input variables.
			\item \textbf{Lipschitz limits} \\
				The limit computation can be improved if a Lipschitz bound on the limit function $f$ is known, i.e. one has an $l$
				such that
				\begin{equation*}
					| f(x) - f(y) | \leq 2^l | x - y | \text{ for } x,y in dom(f).
				\end{equation*}
				Then for $x \in [d-e, d+e]$  
				$$ | a_p(d) - f(x) | \leq | a_p(d) - f(d) | + | f(d) - f(x) |  \leq 2^p + 2^l \cdot e $$
				Thus for large enough $p$ (i.e. such that $2^p > 2^l \cdot e$)
				$$ | a_p(d) - f(x) | \leq  2^{p+1} $$
				To use this in \irram there is a function
				\begin{verbatim}
					REAL limit_lip(REAL a(long, const REAL&), long lip, const REAL& x).
				\end{verbatim}
			\item \textbf{Multi-valued limits}
		\end{enumerate}
	\subsection{Access to the underlying representation}
		Even tough usually the user of \irram should work with the datatype \real
		as if computing exactly with real numbers, sometimes it can be useful to access the internal representation.
		The error of a \real has the following type
		\begin{verbatim}
			struct sizetype { SIZETYPEMANTISSA mantissa; SIZETYPEEXPONENT exponent; }
		\end{verbatim}
		where \code{SIZETYPEMANTISSA} is \code{unsigned int} and \code{SIZETYPEEXPONENT} is int.
		
		An object of type \real has the two functions
		\begin{verbatim}
			void seterror (sizetype error);
			void geterror (sizetype& error) const;
		\end{verbatim}
		to get and set the error.
