Exact Real Arithmetic 

Two case studies have been presented, that show some of the possibilities and
limits of exact real arithmetic.


\section{Possible Future Work}
There are several possible extensions to the implemented case studies.

Some shall be listed here

For the dynamical systems case studies the following is possible
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Forward algorithm}
  \item \textbf{Multi-dimensional shadowing}
\end{enumerate}

The data-type for analytic functions could be extended in the following ways
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Improvement of Running time}
  \item \textbf{Multi-dimensional functions}
  \item \textbf{Applications}
\end{enumerate}
