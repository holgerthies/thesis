  \subsection{Introduction}
  \cite{Hammel1987}
  A chaotic system is a dynamical system, that is highly sensitive to initial conditions.
  A consequence of that is that even relatively small numerical errors in the computation grow exponentially fast.
  A prototypical example of a chaotic system is the logistic map:
  \begin{definition}\label{def:logmap}
  The \textbf{logistic map} is given by the recurrence relation 
  $ x_{n+1} = ax_n(1-x_n) \text{ with } a, x_0 \in \R$.
  \end{definition} 
 \subsubsection{The Shadowing Lemma}
 \begin{definition}\label{def:pseudoorbit}
 A sequence $(x_i)$ is called an \textbf{$\alpha$-pseudo-orbit} for a map $f$ if
 $ \| x_{i+1} - f(x_i) \| < \alpha $  
 \end{definition}
