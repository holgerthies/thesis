  \subsection{Introduction}
  By the term dynamic system we here only mean maps of the form $x_{n+1} = f(x_n)$.
  A chaotic system is a dynamical system, that is highly sensitive to initial conditions.
  A consequence of that is that even relatively small numerical errors in the computation grow exponentially fast.
  A prototypical example of a chaotic system is the logistic map:
  \begin{definition}\label{def:logmap}
  The \textbf{logistic map} is given by the recurrence relation 
  $ x_{n+1} = ax_n(1-x_n) \text{ with } a, x_0 \in \R$.
  \end{definition} 

 \subsubsection{The Shadowing Lemma}
 The term pseudo-orbit is used to describe numerically generated noisy orbits. 
 \begin{definition}\label{def:pseudoorbit}
 A sequence $(x_i)$ is called an \textbf{$\alpha$-pseudo-orbit} for a map $f$ if
 $ \| x_{i+1} - f(x_i) \| < \alpha $  
 \end{definition}

  \begin{definition}\label{def:shadowing}
	A real orbit $(y_i)$ \textbf{$\beta$-shadows} the pseudo-orbit $(x_i)$ if 
	$\| x_i - y_i \| < \beta$.  
 \end{definition}
  For systems that are uniformly hyperbolic Anosov and Bowen could show the following result:
  \begin{theorem}[Shadowing Lemma]
  For all $\beta > 0$ there exists an $\alpha > 0$ so that for every $\alpha$-pseudo-orbit $(x_i)$ there is a point $y_0$ so that the real orbit starting at $y_0$ $\beta$-shadows $(x_i)$.
  \end{theorem} 
  The logistic map is not hyperbolic...\\
  The following case study deals with the case of non-hyperbolic $f$. 
  As stated above, for this case we can not expect to find an orbit that shadows the numerical orbit forever. 
  Instead, there will be an orbit shadowing $(x_i)$ up to some point $n_0$ and then starting to diverge. 
  We want to invesitgate where this $n_0$ is.
  The basis for this case study is a paper by Hammel, Yorke and Grebogi  \cite{Hammel1987}. 
  The paper deals with the question, how long numerical orbits of the logitstic map can be shadowed by true orbits.
  The authors show that for $a = 3.8$ and $x_0 = 0.4$, there is a true orbit $(y_n)$ of the logistic map, so that $\| x_n - y_n \| < 10^{-7}$ for $n \leq 10^7$.
  Their proof method is to compute bounds on the points of the true orbit by using a form of interval arithmetic and letting a computer do the computations. 
  All their computations are done on a Cray X-MP supercomputer. 
  For the case study, first their algorithm was implemented on a modern computer in the \cc programming language, both using fixed precision floating point numbers and \irram. 
  As a second step \irram was used to compute the shadowing orbit exactly.
    \subsubsection{The algorithm}
  A shadowing orbit $(y_n)$ of size $N$ for a pseudo orbit $(x_n)$ of the logistic map $f$ can be computed by setting $y_N = x_N$ and then iteratively applying the inverse map $y_{n-1} = f^{-1}(y_n)$. Since the logistic map is not injective, there is not a unique choice of which inverse to use (In the case of the logistic map there are two possible points to choose). 
  To stay close to the pseudo orbit, in every step the point on the same side of $0.5$ as $x_n$ is chosen.   
  Since the original work had to do all the computations using floating point arithmetics, the inverse could not be computed exactly.
  Instead of the points $y_n$, a sequence of intervals $(I_n)$ that bound the location of $y_n$ is computed, i.e. so that $y_n \in I_n \text{ for } 0 \leq n \leq N$.
  The procedure is started with $I_N := [x_n, x_n]$ and then $I_{n-1}$ is selected so that $I_n \subseteq f(I_{n-1})$ holds and $I_n$ is chosen as small as possible. 
  Then the maximal distance between all points in $I_n$ and $x_n$ is computed.
  This gives a shadowing bound.
  \subsection{Implementation}
  The first part of the case study was to simulate the computations that were made on the Cray X-MP supercomputer on a modern computer. 
  The cray double precision data type used for the computations in the paper has machine epsilon $\eps_\mu = 2^{-95}$.
  To compute the intervals $I_n$ from $I_{n+1}$ the inverse of the interval is computed as described above (using floating point arithmetic).
  Then as long as $I_{n+1} \not \subseteq f(I_n)$, $I_n$ is enlarged on both sides by the minimal possible quantity $\eps_\mu$. 
  Since also the computation of $f(I_n)$ is done using floating point arithmetics, the condition might still not be fulfilled.
  This can, however, be compensated by further enlargening the interval on both sides by the constant $10^{-25}$.
