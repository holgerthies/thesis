A large amount of problems that are solved with the help of computers are
problems dealing with real numbers.

The most common way to represent real numbers on a computer is the use of floating point
arithmetic.
The floating point representation of a real number is a finite word, consisting
of mantissa and exponent of fixed length.
Due to the finiteness of the representation it is unavoidable that errors
occur.
While in many cases the error stays small, there are also several examples
where computations with floating point numbers yield results that are
completely wrong.

In any case, the error is not visible from the result, thus floating point
arithmetic is not a reliable way to perform real number computations.

Writing reliable algorithms on numerical problems requires however a sound
theoretical foundation.

While for discrete-valued problems there is a widely accepted theory for
computability and complexity, there are several non-equivalent theories for
computations on real numbers.

One such theory is the Type-2 Theory of Effectivity (TTE) \cite{Wei}.
In TTE reals are represented as infinite strings over some finite alphabet
$\Sigma$.
A real number is computable in TTE if it is possible to approximate it with any
desired precision.

TTE is supposed to be a realistic model, in the sense, that exactly those
real numbers and functions are computable in TTE, that can be computed with a
computer.

Similar to the discrete-valued case a vast theory on computability and
complexity has been built upon TTE \cite{viel}.

Since TTE strives to be a realistic model, an important task is to compare
theoretical claims with practical implementations.

There are already quite a few implementations for reliable computations with
real numbers (exact real arithmetic).
One that has been proven to be particularly fast and therefore well-suited for
practical implementations, is Norbert M\"uller's \cc framework \irram
\cite{irram}.

\irram extends \cc by classes and functions for error-free computations with
real numbers.
The details of the internal representation are taken care of by the framework. 
Thus, the user can write ordinary \cc extended by data-type that behave like
real numbers, without thinking about rounding errors.

This thesis presents two case studies in exact real arithmetic, both using the
\irram framework to implement the algorithms.

The first case-study shows how exact real arithmetic can be used to get simpler
algorithms for old problems in numerical analysis.
The particular problem considered, is the shadowing distance for chaotic
dynamic systems, i.e. how close a numerically computed orbit of a map $f: \RR
\to \RR$ is followed by an exact orbit.
This problem was originally considered by \temp{name} \cite{asda}. 
Since they could not compute real numbers exactly, they used a form of interval
arithmetic to bound the exact orbit.
However, \irram can be used to compute the exact orbit and thus getting a
simplified version of their algorithm.

The second case-study deals with analytic functions. 
Analytic functions have been thoroughly studied in real complexity theory, as a
subset of real functions where many problems that are computationally hard in
the general case become feasible. 
To show how well those complexity claims compare with practical
implementations, data-types to represent analytic functions have been written.
The implementation is meant as an extension to the \irram framework, that
provides user-friendly classes for computations with analytic functions.
Empirical evaluation was done on the running time of those classes and compared
with the expected running times from the theoretical examination.
